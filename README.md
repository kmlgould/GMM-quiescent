# GMM-quiescent

- Under construction, please check back regularly - 


Simple code to assign a probability of quiescence to a galaxy given its rest frame NUV,U,V,J fluxes using a Gaussian Mixture Model from the Scikit-learn python library (Pedregosa et al., 2011). 

Please see the notebook on how to fit and implement the GMM on photometric catalogs.
